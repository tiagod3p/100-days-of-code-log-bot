## About this Project

The idea of the project is:

_"Learn and share the knowledge about how to do automating bots with python."._

## Why?

This project is part of my studies about Python and automation. By doing this I intend that other people could learn with me, and myself could learn with them.

## Some Observations about this Project

2 - The chromedriver that I used could be different for you, it depends of your chrome version. Remember check it.

3 - Some of the XPATH code you need to change to run in your machine


## Functionalities

- Add your progress and thoughts just typing it on terminal.
